# Product 4: LegacyBridge AI Gateway

## Executive Summary

LegacyBridge AI Gateway is a secure integration layer that enables financial institutions to safely connect AI agents to legacy core banking systems without risking data corruption, system instability, or security breaches. It acts as a protective wrapper around aging core platforms (FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Temenos) while enabling modern AI-driven innovation.

## Product Vision

"The safe way to modernize without replacement" - Protect legacy core banking systems from AI agent risks while enabling innovation, deferring $50M+ core replacement projects, and maintaining operational stability.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions face a critical dilemma:

**Legacy Core Dependency**: 70% of banks run on cores from the 1980s-1990s that weren't designed for AI agents
**Replacement Cost**: Full core replacement costs $50M-500M and takes 3-5 years
**AI Innovation Pressure**: Banks must deploy AI agents to remain competitive, but legacy cores are fragile
**Risk of Corruption**: AI agents interacting directly with legacy cores can corrupt data, break integrations, or cause system outages
**Recovery Costs**: Data corruption recovery averages $8M+ and takes weeks to months

## Target Customer Profile

**Primary Buyers:**
- Chief Technology Officers (CTOs)
- Core Banking System Managers
- Chief Information Officers (CIOs)
- Heads of Digital Transformation

**Institution Types:**
- Regional to G-SIB banks with legacy cores
- Banks acquired through M&A (inherited legacy systems)
- PE portfolio companies with acquired banks
- Credit unions with aging core platforms

**Buying Triggers:**
- AI agent deployment initiatives
- Post-incident remediation (data corruption, system outage)
- M&A integration (standardizing across legacy cores)
- Regulatory pressure to modernize (without full replacement)

## Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. API Gateway with Strict Schema Validation

**What it does:**
- Intercepts all AI agent requests to legacy core systems
- Validates request structure against strict schemas
- Blocks malformed or suspicious requests before they reach core
- Provides modern REST/GraphQL APIs for AI agents (legacy cores use older protocols)

**Validation Layers:**
- **Schema Validation**: Request matches expected structure
- **Data Type Validation**: Correct data types (no SQL injection, buffer overflows)
- **Business Rule Validation**: Amounts within limits, valid account numbers
- **Security Validation**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting

**Technical Implementation:**
- API gateway (Kong, AWS API Gateway, custom)
- Schema registry (JSON Schema, OpenAPI)
- Request transformation (modern API → legacy protocol)
- Response transformation (legacy format → modern API)

**User Value:**
- Prevent malformed requests from reaching fragile legacy cores
- Modern API interface for AI agents (easier integration)
- Reduce core system errors by 90%

### 2. Transaction Reversibility Enforcement

**What it does:**
